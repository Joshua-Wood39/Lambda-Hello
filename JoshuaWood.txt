Hi!
My name is Joshua Wood.
I am tasty, a dreamer, and high in protein. I also don't know how to describe myself without sounding arrogant,
so I think I use wit as a self-defense mechanism.
Hobbies: a minor king among nerds (or a Lord), I have two degrees in Music Theory and Composition,
I play Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons.
I am a gamer: both on board and on console(s).
I read. A lot.
And I'm incredibly excited to be studying at Lambda College.
